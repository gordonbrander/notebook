<h1>What are Web Activities?</h1>
<p>Web Activities allow information to be sent between apps.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, Web Activities allow any app or webpage do the kind of
native integration that would <strong>typically require privileged API access</strong>.</p>
<p>At a high-level, there are 2 sides to web activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can call an activity from your app and be presented with apps that can handle it.</li>
<li>You may register an app to support an activity type.</li>
</ul>
