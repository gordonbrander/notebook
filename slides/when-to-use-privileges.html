<h1>So, when does an app actually need to be privileged?</h1>
<p>Very rarely. For most cases you can use Web Activities and bypass the need for privileged API access.</p>
<p>For example, if your app needs camera access, all you have to do is ask for a photo via an activity. An activity sheet will pop up, and after the user takes the photo, your app will receive it. No privileged access necessary.</p>
