<h1>Can I create new web activity types?</h1>
<p>Absolutely! An application will be able to create new activities.</p>
<p>For example, an application can register itself as handling the activity <code>foobar</code>. Any other application is able to start the activity <code>foobar</code>.</p>
<p>To prevent naming collision problems, we recommend custom naming to be prefixed with your URL (for example: <code>example.org/foobar</code>).</p>
