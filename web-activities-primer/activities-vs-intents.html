<h1>What is the difference between Web Activities and Web Intents?</h1>
<p>Web Activities is a simplified counter-proposal to Web Intents.</p>
<p>It limits the scope of the API to the following use case: <em><strong>App A</strong> wants to delegate an activity to <strong>App B</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Web Activities isn&#39;t a discovery API or a communication API. Those things happen in the background and are completely transparent to the caller.</p>
