What privileges do I need?
========================

**None!** Any web app or website can use Web Activities.

This means you can leverage native features, not just in packaged apps, but in web apps, and even websites!

Having secure native feature integration for **both packaged and network apps** means you can choose the update and delivery model that works best for the content (versioned updates, silent updates or any combination thereof).
