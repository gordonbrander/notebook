So, when does an app actually need to be privileged?
========================

Very rarely. For most cases you can use Web Activities and bypass the need for privileged API access.

For example, if your app needs camera access, all you have to do is ask for a photo via an activity. An activity sheet will pop up, and after the user takes the photo, your app will receive it. No privileged access necessary.
