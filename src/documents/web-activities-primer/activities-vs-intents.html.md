What is the difference between Web Activities and Web Intents?
==============================================================

Web Activities is a simplified counter-proposal to Web Intents.

It limits the scope of the API to the following use case: _**App A** wants to delegate an activity to **App B**_.

Web Activities isn't a discovery API or a communication API. Those things happen in the background and are completely transparent to the caller.
