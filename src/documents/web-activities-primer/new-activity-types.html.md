Can I create new web activity types?
========================

Absolutely! An application will be able to create new activities.

For example, an application can register itself as handling the activity `foobar`. Any other application is able to start the activity `foobar`.

To prevent naming collision problems, we recommend custom naming to be prefixed with your URL (for example: `example.org/foobar`).
