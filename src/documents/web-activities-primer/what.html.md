What are Web Activities?
========================

Web Activities allow information to be sent between apps.

Practically speaking, Web Activities allow any app or webpage do the kind of
native integration that would **typically require privileged API access**.

At a high-level, there are 2 sides to Web Activities:

* You can call an activity from your app and be presented with apps that can handle it.
* You may register an app to support an activity type.
